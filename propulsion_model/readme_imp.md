Several features were used to predict #GT Compressor decay state coefficient. & #GT Turbine decay state coefficient.

1)The features did not have missing values and most of them had a direct impact on our target predictions. 

2)Two models(regression) were used to predict with GT Compressor decay state coefficient value, Which resulted in 85% accuracy. 

3)The third regression model used to predict GT Turbine decay state coefficient, Resulted in 91% accuracy when tested on our 'Test_data'. 
4)Further feature engineering was avoided as the data given was sufficient enough for good results. 

5)Finally, Prediction comparison can be seen towards the end for human interpretation.
